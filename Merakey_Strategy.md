# Merakey – Strategy & MYHC Deal Playbook (May 2025)

Prepared 01 May 2025  —  CONFIDENTIAL / INTERNAL ONLY

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 0. Why this document exists

•  We need a single source-of-truth that captures how Merakey will:  
   1. Get paid fast through milestone-based projects.  
   2. Win MYHC as our flagship customer AND gain more customers.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Merakey north-star

1. Become the go-to secure AI platform for Canadian health & other mission-critical organisations – vertical-agnostic by design.  
2. Ship **agentic AI workflows** in *days*, treating each codebase as disposable.  
3. Capture value through milestone-based, outcome-priced projects (cash fast), not time sheets.
4. Preserve freedom to re-implement anything from scratch; our moat is the recipe book + customer relationship, not any single repo.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. What’s really valuable to us

1. Paying reference customers who validate the platform’s speed & compliance.  
2. Rapid cash-flow – milestone invoices that land inside 30–45 days.  
3. Being allowed to approach other oraganizations and provide fresh solutions for them without reusing customer's code. 

### Hardware, source code lines and UI chrome are *getting cheaper every month*; the scarce asset is the relationship and our ability to keep iterating new workflows quickly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 3. Core tension with MYHC

| Merakey needs | MYHC (Khalid) needs |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Reusable platform IP | Defensible advantage vs. other pharmacies |
| Fast payment milestones | Confidence the work won’t later power his competitors |
| Portfolio story for future verticals | Clear ownership for modules he funds |

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Why milestone pricing beats hourly billing

1. Aligns incentives – we’re paid for outcomes, not for being busy.  
2. Easier for Khalid’s finance team to budget.  
3. Removes risk of scope-creep arguments; each milestone has agreed deliverables.  
4. Lets us forecast cash-flow accurately.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Longer-term roadmap snapshot

| Phase | Duration | Goal | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| Pilot (P0) | 2 months | 2 automations live, first payments collected | Milestone billing; gather metrics |
| Scale (P1) | +4 months | Rollout to ≥ 10 pharmacies | Add monitoring & analytics module |
| Platform GA (P2) | +6 months | Offer platform to 2nd vertical (e.g. clinics) | Leverage rebuilt workflows, reuse infra |

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 6. FAQ reference

**Q – What if MYHC insists on owning everything?**  
We can agree to rebuild any future solution from scratch. The agentic tooling cuts rebuild cost drastically, so surrendering ownership of *one* implementation is acceptable provided payment covers effort + margin.

**Q – Why not jump straight to a generic SaaS?**  
12–24 months runway with no paying customers is risky. A flagship account de-risks compliance, funds development and provides a credible case study.

**Q – How do we stop scope creep?**  
Use a living backlog but only commit milestones in writing; new requests queue into future milestones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
## 10. Rules of engagement – “Disposable Code, Durable Relationship”

1. **IP stance** – Client owns the final repo; Merakey may always rebuild a new implementation from scratch.  
2. **Outcome pricing** – No hourly rates. Each milestone is priced against measurable ROI.  
3. **Milestones, not timesheets** – 40 % due at kick-off, 60 % on KPI acceptance.  
4. **Internal recipe book** – Prompts, orchestrator configs and eval scripts stay private; never exported.  
5. **Re-build guarantee** – If a client ever needs a clean-room version, Merakey will recreate it at a capped rate.  
6. **Contract simplicity** – 2–3 pages: Scope/KPI, Milestones/Payments, IP clause, Termination.  
7. **Lead qualification** – Chase only problems with ≥10× fee ROI; offer a paid Week-Zero discovery.  
8. **Marketing narrative** – Sell speed-to-value: “asked Monday, live Friday.”  
9. **Internal KPI** – Days from signed SOW to first cash; relentlessly compress this cycle.
