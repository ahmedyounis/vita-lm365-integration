# Design automation for repetitive tasks and workflows

Examples: `--email Daily project updates` | `--calendar Meeting prep tasks` | `--daily Morning routine`

Workflow: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions:
- If "--email" flag is present, focus on email automation
- If "--calendar" flag is present, focus on calendar automation  
- If "--project" flag is present, focus on project management automation
- If "--daily" flag is present, create daily routine automation
- If "--weekly" flag is present, create weekly routine automation

## Automation Analysis:

1. **Task Identification**
   - Break down the workflow into discrete steps
   - Identify repetitive or manual components
   - Analyze current time investment and pain points
   - Determine automation potential for each step

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Map available tools (Gmail, Calendar, Notion, etc.)
   - Identify API capabilities and limitations
   - Design integration between different services
   - Plan data flow and synchronization

3. **Automation Design**
   - Create step-by-step automation workflow
   - Define triggers and conditions
   - Specify actions and responses
   - Include error handling and fallbacks

4. **Implementation Plan**
   - Prioritize automation components by impact
   - Estimate development time and complexity
   - Identify any custom commands needed
   - Plan testing and validation approach

5. **Efficiency Metrics**
   - Calculate time savings potential
   - Identify quality improvements
   - Measure error reduction benefits
   - Define success criteria

6. **Next Steps**
   - Create specific action items for implementation
   - Suggest Claude Code commands to create
   - Recommend workflow optimizations
   - Plan gradual rollout strategy

Focus on practical, immediate improvements that can be implemented with existing tools and capabilities.
