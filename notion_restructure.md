## üí∞ COMMERCIAL APPROACH

### Pricing Strategy
- Milestone-based pricing following Merakey's "Disposable Code, Durable Relationship" philosophy
- 3-phase implementation over 2-3 months
- Vita owns final integration code, Merakey retains methodology

### Market Context
- Healthcare LMS integrations typically $50-65K initial + $30-40K annual
- Competitive positioning through API-only approach
- Value proposition: Faster delivery, lower cost, content ownership respected

---

## üìù KEY DECISIONS & CONSTRAINTS

### Technical Constraints
- **Helen's Requirement:** All educational content must remain on Seamless portal
- **Integration Method:** API-based only, no content migration
- **Vita's Responsibility:** Programming their LM365 system to consume API

### Business Decisions
- Timeline reduced from 6-8 months to 2-3 months
- Focus on status tracking rather than content delivery
- Seamless maintains control of training materials
