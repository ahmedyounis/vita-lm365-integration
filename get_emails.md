# Goal: Use Gmail mcp server to get a summary for my emails with Notion project integration

Please read my important unread emails from the last 7 days only. Use the Gmail MCP server efficiently by:

1. **Primary search:** `is:unread is:important after:[7_days_ago_date]`
2. **Account alerts:** `is:unread is:important (alert OR warning OR suspend OR balance OR "action needed")`
3. **Property specific:** `is:unread is:important (Ambria OR Amanda OR Yaprak OR Golden Meadows)`
4. **Business critical:** `is:unread is:important (meeting OR invite OR invoice OR payment OR urgent OR ASAP)`
5. **ONLY if no important results:** `is:unread after:[7_days_ago_date]` (fallback to all unread)
6. Limit initial results to 15 emails max (focus on quality over quantity)

## Notion Project Context Integration

For each email category, after reading email content:

1. **Search Notion projects database** for related projects using keywords from:
   - Sender company names (Vita, MYHC, Seamless Care, Bell, Westmount)
   - Project names (RHPA Training, LM365 Integration, Account Transfer)
   - Technical terms (API, integration, training, fiber, portal)
   - Client/stakeholder names

2. **Retrieve project pages** for matches and include:
   - Project status (Active/Planning/Completed/On Hold)
   - Key stakeholders and contacts
   - Current phase/milestone
   - Budget/timeline information
   - Recent updates or blockers

3. **Cross-reference email actions** with project status:
   - Link email requests to existing project tasks
   - Identify new project opportunities
   - Flag potential project updates needed
   - Note timeline impacts or scope changes

## Project Discovery Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Project Keywords
From each email, identify:
- Company/organization names
- Project codenames or references
- Technical terms (API, integration, training)
- Timeline references and deadlines
- Budget/cost mentions
- Stakeholder names and roles

### Step 2: Search Notion Database
Use Notion MCP to search for projects containing:
- Exact company matches
- Similar project themes
- Related stakeholders
- Technology stack overlap
- Timeline intersections

### Step 3: Project Context Summary
For each email with project matches:
- Current project health (on track/at risk/blocked)
- Recent activity or updates needed
- Stakeholder alignment status
- Next milestone dates
- Budget status

6. **Prioritize reading full content** for emails that are:
   - **Property management related** (Ambria, Amanda, tenants)
   - **Financial/payment related** (invoices, payments, account alerts)
   - **Meeting invitations or scheduling**
   - **Auto-replies that provide useful info** (timelines, contact details)
   - **Security/account alerts** (low balance, service disruptions)
   - **Action items requiring immediate response**

7. **Skip full content reading** for:
   - Marketing/promotional emails (unless from known business contacts)
   - Auto-replies that are just "message received" confirmations
   - Newsletter/educational content (Skool, Ndax, Trello, etc.)
   - Social media notifications and community updates
   - Old emails (>30 days) unless specifically urgent
   - Any email not marked as "important" by Gmail's algorithm

For each email category, provide:
- Email ID (for follow-up actions)
- Thread ID (for conversation tracking)
- Subject line
- Sender name and email
- Date received
- **Detailed summary with specific bullet points** including:
  - Main topic/issue discussed
  - Specific details, numbers, dates, names mentioned
  - Recommendations or solutions provided
  - Attachments or resources referenced
  - Timeline or next steps indicated
  - Key stakeholders or contacts involved
- Required action
- Suggested response (if needed)

Format the output as:

## Email Signature Integration

When creating ANY emails (drafts, replies, or direct sends), ALWAYS include the professional signature:

### Required Signature Format:
- **MIME Type:** `text/html` (required for image display)
- **Include both `body` and `htmlBody` parameters**
- **Signature HTML:** 
```html
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1vfZgFtTwLvi3vII2k3CUZJIhrTmGl9pr" alt="Ahmed Younis - Merakey" style="width: 240px; height: auto; display: block;">
```

### Email Format Requirements:
```javascript
mimeType: "text/html"
body: "[Plain text version of email content]"
htmlBody: "[HTML version with proper HTML formatting and signature at end]"
```

### HTML Formatting Rules:
- **Use `<strong>` tags instead of `**` for bold text**
- **Use `<br>` tags instead of `\n` for line breaks**
- **Use proper HTML structure in `htmlBody`**
- **Never mix markdown syntax with HTML format**

### Example Implementation:
```
body: "Hi [Name],\n\nMeeting Details:\n- Date: Tuesday\n- Time: 1:00 PM\n\nBest,\nAhmed"

htmlBody: "Hi [Name],<br><br><strong>Meeting Details:</strong><br>- <strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday<br>- <strong>Time:</strong> 1:00 PM<br><br>Best,<br>Ahmed<br><br><img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1vfZgFtTwLvi3vII2k3CUZJIhrTmGl9pr' alt='Ahmed Younis - Merakey' style='width: 240px; height: auto; display: block;'>"
```

**CRITICAL:** 
- Never send emails without the signature
- Always use HTML format for professional emails
- Use proper HTML tags (not markdown) in htmlBody
- The signature already contains full name/title, so don't duplicate "Ahmed" in the closing

## Follow-up Commands

```
Mark the following emails as read:
- ID: [messageId1]
- ID: [messageId2]
- ID: [messageId3]
```

### Batch Operations
```
Please perform these batch operations:
1. Mark all financial emails as read: [ID1, ID2, ID3]
2. Archive all promotional emails: [ID4, ID5]

## Draft Email Management

After reading emails, Claude should:
1. **Create draft replies** for emails requiring responses
2. **Save drafts in correct threads** using threadId
3. **Ask for review** before sending any emails
4. **Always include professional signature** - Use HTML format with Merakey logo
5. **Provide draft IDs** for tracking

Example workflow:
- Read important emails
- Create draft replies and save to threads
- Report: "Draft created with ID: r123456789 - please review before sending"

## Token Efficiency Best Practices

1. **Batch tool calls** - Use multiple tool calls in single messages
2. **Limit email length** - Keep email bodies under 1000 characters when possible
3. **Use HTML format** - Always use HTML for professional appearance
4. **Skip redundant content** - Don't read duplicate emails in same thread
5. **Prioritize recent emails** - Focus on last 7 days unless specified otherwise

## Notion Query Efficiency

1. **Batch project searches** - Search for multiple keywords in single query
2. **Limit project page reads** - Only read full pages for high-priority matches
3. **Use project summaries** - Focus on status, timeline, and stakeholder sections
4. **Cache project info** - Store frequently accessed project details for session
5. **Selective retrieval** - Only fetch project details when email has clear business relevance

## Efficiency Tips

1. **Always use batch operations** when marking multiple emails as read
2. **Use specific date ranges** to minimize token usage
3. **Skip email content retrieval** for obvious spam/marketing
4. **Group similar actions** (e.g., mark all invoice emails as read together)

## Example Follow-up Workflow

```
User: Give me my email summary
Claude: [Provides structured summary with IDs]

User: Mark emails 196edad436c34c1b, 1970d2c2fb976be4, and 1970cd0281457955 as read
Claude: [Batch marks as read]

User: Archive the promotional email from Amanda Davis
Claude: [Archives email ID 1970d2c2fb976be4]

User: Create a "Needs Response" label and apply it to the RHPA training email
Claude: [Creates label and applies to email ID 1970d2473ae98f6c]
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Email Truncation (showing "...")
- **Cause:** Email body too long for Gmail MCP server
- **Solution:** Keep emails under 1000 characters, use HTML format
- **Fix:** Rewrite email more concisely with proper HTML formatting

### Emails Still Show Unread
- **Cause:** Multiple emails in thread, only some marked as read
- **Solution:** Check thread for additional unread emails
- **Action:** Use search to verify: `is:unread is:important after:[date]`

### Too Many Unimportant Emails
- **Cause:** Gmail not properly marking emails as important
- **Solution:** Focus only on `is:important` filter, skip promotional content
- **Action:** Train Gmail's importance markers by manually marking business emails as important

### Auto-Replies vs Real Responses
- **Distinguish:** Auto-replies often contain "automatic reply" or standard templates
- **Action:** Mark pure acknowledgment auto-replies as read, keep informative ones

## New Project Detection & Creation

Flag emails that may require new projects:
- New client inquiries with scope discussions
- Integration requests from unknown companies
- Budget/quote requests for undefined work
- Meeting requests for "discovery" or "requirements"
- Account transfers or service migrations

### Auto-Project Creation Criteria
If email contains:
- Quote request + scope definition + timeline
- New client + technical requirements
- Budget discussion + implementation plan
- Service transfer with multiple stakeholders
- Suggest creating new Notion project page with initial stakeholders and scope

## External Integration

When encountering property management emails:
- **Reference Notion page:** Golden Meadows Property Management for context
- **Cross-reference tasks:** Check existing todo items and priorities
- **Update tracking:** Note completed actions (repairs, payments, contacts)

When encountering business development emails:
- **Search for existing client projects** in Notion database
